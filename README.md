# Introducing to Object-oriented programming `(OOP)`
>Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams in C++

### Note
I developed this modules without *TDD* `(Test-driven development)` but now I start to implement it
from the first exercices.

If you wanna run tests you should install google tests framework on your system if you don't have yet.
this is the repository with documentation ![google test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest)

If you install correctly, (in root directory of exercice like `ex00`) type `make run_tests` and output should be like this ~~(module_00/ex00)~~:

# About modules and exercices
## ![Module 00](module_00/)
> This module is to learn about syntax of language and understand how
> to create a class and methods, read a code made in cpp and implement classes using this
> provided files as base.

## ![Module 01](module_01/)
> This module is about pointers to members, memory allocation, references, switch statements.

## ![Module 02](module_02/)
> This module is about polymorphism, ![operator overloading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-cpp/) and ![Orthodox Canonical class form](https://www.francescmm.com/orthodox-canonical-class-form/)

## ![Module 03](module_03/)
> This module is about inheritance in general, and about the ![diamond problem](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-diamond-problem-in-cpp/).

## ![Module 04](module_04/)
> This module is about ![subtype polymorphism](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23505346/conceptual-difference-between-parametric-polymorphism-and-subtype-polymorphism), abstract classes and interfaces.

## ![Module 05](module_05/)
> This module is to trainning the past concepts and work with exceptions.

## ![Module 06](module_06/)
> This module is about casting, conversion of scalar types, serialization, identify real type and so forth.

## ![Module 07](module_07/)
> This module is about templates, how to use and create them.

 ## ![Module 08](module_08/)
> This module we start to work with ![STL](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cpp-tutorial/cpp-standard-template-library) `(standard template library)`, templated containers and more iterators.
